services_text1: "We are developing an open-source distributed decentralized object data storage project called [NeoFS](https://fs.neo.org). Our mission is to make data reliably stored, accessible at any time and fully controllable by the owner. All of these properties are satisfied in an untrusted environment, making decentralized technologies as easy and as fast to use as centralized ones. The system has a unique architecture and implementation that allows using it as a global storage network with no single point of failure and reaching enterprise-grade performance in on-premise deployments at the same time."
services_text2: "The objective is a modular system with the following features:"
services_text3: "Peer-to-peer storage solution"
services_text4: "Fault-tolerance"
services_text5: "Global scalability"
services_text6: "Self-sustaining due to a built-in economic incentive system that can be used in various business cases for public or private distributed decentralized object storages"
services_logo3: "Neo Lambda"
services_text7: "We are developing a decentralized, stateless and serverless computing platform integrated with Neo Blockchain"
services_logo4: "NeoGO"
services_text8: "We are developing and supporting [Neo Node](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neo-go) implementation in Golang"
